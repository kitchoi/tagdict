    TagDict is similar to a dictionary except 
    
    Keys are unique tags/attributes of all the items
    Each key can be mapped onto multiple items that have
    that key as a tag
    
    TagDict[*tags] returns a list of items that share the same tags
    TagDict["*"] returns all the items

        Example:
        TagDict["a","b"] returns all items that have both "a" 
                         and "b" as tags
        TagDict["*"] returns all the items in the TagDict
